# Contributing

Firstly thank you for contributing to our project! When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, comments on issue or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Smaller is better.
   Big changes are significantly less likely to be accepted and or might take time to be merged.

Try not to take on too much at once. As a first-time contributor, we recommend starting with small and simple PRs in order to become familiar with the codebase. Most of the work should go into discovering which three lines need to change rather than writing the code.
